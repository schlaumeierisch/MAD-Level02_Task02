# MAD-Level02_Task02
Task 2 of the second level assignment in "Mobile Application Development" at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Computer Science, 5th semester).

## Task
Create a quiz where a user can swipe the question to the left if he thinks the statement is incorrect or swipe the question to the right if he thinks the statement is correct. When a user swipes a question, and the answer is correct then the question is removed from the list. Otherwise, the app should give feedback via a Snackbar message that the question will not be removed from the list. Clicking on an item presents the user with a sneak preview about whether the questions answer is true or false.
